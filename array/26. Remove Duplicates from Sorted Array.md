27. Remove Element

Given an integer array nums and an integer $val$, remove all occurrences of val in nums **in-place**. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the **number** of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

**Change the array nums** such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.

**Return k**.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

idea:
two loops. the first one tries to find val in nums, and the second one moves all nums behind this index to previous index.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        // if (nums.size() == 1) return 1;
        // if (nums.size() == 2) {
        //     if(nums[0] == nums[1]) return 1;
        //     else return 2;
        // }
        for (i = 0; i < nums.size()-1; i++) {
            if(nums[j] != nums[i+1]){
                j++;
                nums[j] = nums[i+1];
                // nums[j] = nums[i+1];
                // j++;
                cout << i << " " << j<< endl;
            }
        }
        return j+1;
    }
};
```
