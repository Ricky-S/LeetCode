# 191. Number of 1 Bits

You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target.

Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

ex1
```cpp
Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
```

ex2
```cpp
Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]
```

ex3
```cpp
Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12
Output: 61
Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them do not satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).
Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).
```

Constraints\
```cpp
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
1 <= target <= 10^6
```

idea:\

two pointers, one pointer is from start to last. and another pointer is from last to start.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int power(int num) {
        int result;
        if (num == 1) return 2;
        else if (num == 0) return 1;
        else {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                result = power(num/2) % (1000000007);
                result = ((long long)result*(long long)result) % (1000000007);
            }else {
                result = power((num-1)/2) % (1000000007);
                result = ((long long)result*(long long)result*2) % (1000000007);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    int numSubseq(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int lowIndex{ 0 };
        int highIndex = nums.size()-1;
        int result { 0 };
        while (lowIndex <= highIndex) {
            if (nums[highIndex] + nums[lowIndex] <= target) {
                int rangeLength = highIndex - lowIndex;
                result = ((long long)result + power(rangeLength)) % (1000000007);
                lowIndex++;
            }else {
                highIndex--;
            }
        }
        return result;     
    }
};
```
