# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-15)

## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
- **Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in `O(n)`.

**Follow up:**
  - Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)


## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [1] * n
        left = 1
        for i in range(n):
            res[i] = left
            left *= nums[i]
        right = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] *= right
            right *= nums[i]
        return res
```
